What is the ideal typeface for landing pages?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing your landing page, you will have encountered one of the biggest doubts that usually exists: typography. Finding the perfect typeface for landing pages is tricky, as each typeface has an &#8220;ideal&#8221; use and its readability varies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#ecf8f4\"><strong>According to many studies, reading on the screen is 25% more difficult and slower than reading something that’s printed on paper.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the web, in fact, we read when we are really interested in it. We tend to look for highlighted words or more significant titles to understand if the page corresponds to what we are looking for. Everything that does not seem important to us and all those parts where the text is not easy to read is skipped by us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, without a doubt choosing the correct typeface is a factor to consider when designing a landing page. It is not a mere designer whim: finding the right typeface can affect the conversion rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shape of the words also has the power to communicate, beyond what the words say. Knowing that power and how to apply it is important to drive your marketing goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Typography?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Typography can be defined as typefaces that share common characteristics. Numbers and symbols are also included in that common type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All fonts vary from one another on issues such as thickness, spacing, serif, etc. All these elements make a typeface have its own, personal characteristics, necessary to differentiate itself from others.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Choose The Perfect Typeface For Your Landing Page?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of fonts can be very interesting and lead to results of all kinds. For this reason, it is not surprising that when designing a website, you end up making beginner mistakes, easy to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips you can follow to find an ideal landing page font:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Clarity Above All</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Users generally do not spend more than a few seconds viewing the content of a page. For this reason, the fonts you choose must be readable in a very short time, and must be displayed perfectly on mobile. Use a few different fonts, to achieve a clear hierarchy of information that helps users quickly understand the content of the landing page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Hind and Montserrat work very well for headlines. For smaller text sizes, like product descriptions, choose something serifed like Merriweather that works great for body text or Open Sans that adjusts to a wide variety of weights making it more versatile.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Combine Fonts With Each Other And With Other Visual Elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an art to compose with types that combine well. However, it is not convenient to choose more than two or three different types for the same landing page, so choose wisely how to combine. A good tactic is to choose a font family and use its variants (light, bold, condensed).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in turn, keep in mind how those fonts look with the visual environment of the landing page: the colors, the images, the layout. There are fonts that look great on a blank screen, but with some color combination they become illegible. Try different options to see which ones look perfect in your design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try the combination of headlines in Lato (Thin) with body text in Merriweather for something elegant. The titles in Roboto Slab and text in Open Sans are also very good for something more dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Convey The Essence Of The Product</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Typography has the power to evoke certain sensations that must be aligned with the product or service that you are promoting on your landing page. And that has a strong cultural support: in certain areas, we are used to seeing certain typefaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respecting those expectations helps to communicate the message more easily and connect better with the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your landing is for wedding cakes, an italic typeface for the headline and an elegant Serifa to detail the menu will work best. If instead you have a technology startup for students, you will opt for a modern and practical typeface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to thinking about the product, service or category of your landing, think about your audience. For younger generations, aim for more trendy fonts like Roboto or Lato. If your audience is more mature, choose fonts that convey confidence and seriousness, such as Times New Roman or Georgia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Take Care Of The Institutional Image</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work with a brand that has a well-defined aesthetic, with a typography already established for its graphic content, you must take care that the typefaces of your landing are aligned to them. And if there is no guideline regarding the fonts to be used, check that they match well with the logo. The design of your landing can not be a collage of aesthetic cutouts. It should give a unified and pleasant message.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Be Original Without Losing Simplicity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some designs deliberately seek to break some typographic rules to generate a new meaning. If you are going to design “out of the box” (for example, combining two typefaces in the same paragraph, or creating an entirely typographic composition, without images), you must do it intentionally and make sure that the artistic game does not go against your conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take advantage of the A / B Testing tool to find out which typefaces bring the best conversion results.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Where To Look For The Ideal Typography For Your Website?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By offering an intuitive and robust collection of open source designer web fonts, Google Fonts has established itself in the world of web design as the go to source for typefaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google font is:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A catalog of 915 font families</li><li>Fonts available in 135 languages</li><li>100% free and open source fonts</li><li>Fonts that are easy to install and the fastest to load</li><li>Fonts compatible with all browsers and devices</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The richness and diversity of the fonts offered is undoubtedly an element that explains the success of Google Fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#ecf8f4\"><strong>To integrate a Google Fonts font, simply copy and paste a line of HTML code into the &lt;head> of your website and fill in the @ font-face rule in your CSS. The integration is extremely simple, especially when compared with Flash or JavaScript integrations.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, Google Fonts allows you to easily mix several fonts, in order to create combinations. The number of possible combinations is enormous.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>On Which Criteria To Choose Your Google Fonts?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Faced with the quantity of fonts available on Google Fonts, a question immediately arises: how to choose a font? What criteria should be taken into account? Defined below are 4 criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Readability</strong>, which is the most important criterion. The font must be as readable as possible, whatever the type of screen used and the display resolution.</li><li><strong>Flexibility and diversity</strong>. The font must offer at least three styles (light, regular, bold…) in order to allow you to rank the pages of your website.</li><li><strong>Efficiency</strong>. You must choose a font with a full glyphset. In fact, many free fonts have a very small number of glyphs (= special characters).</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong>. The font must be compatible with any browser. You must also take into account the &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; compatibility. The quality of the font must not be impacted by the quality of screens or operating systems.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Effectively Combine Google Fonts?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips for finding good font combinations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Use Font Families:</strong> Font families are groups of fonts that go well together. Combining two fonts belonging to the same family allows you to vary your fonts without any risk of errors. Google Fonts are precisely grouped by families.</li><li><strong>Play with contrasts:</strong> The whole point of combining several fonts is to then be able to play with contrasts. It is interesting, for example, to combine a &#8220;fat&#8221; font with a &#8220;light&#8221; sans-serif font. Mixing two fonts that are very similar from an aesthetic point of view is of no real interest and affects readability.</li><li><strong>Limit yourself to a maximum of three fonts</strong>, both for readability and load time reasons. Adding web fonts tends to slow the loading time of your pages.</li><li><strong>Choose combinations depending on the type of content</strong> that is present on your site. If you go for a modern writing style and editorial line, choose a font that exemplifies this quality.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A few font associations that work quite well:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lobster &amp; Cabin</li><li>Raleway &amp; Goudy Bookletter 1911</li><li>Allerta &amp; Crimson Text</li><li>Arvo &amp; PT Without</li><li>Dancing Script &amp; Josefin Sans</li><li>Allan &amp; Cardo</li><li>Molengo &amp; Lekton</li><li>Droid Serif &amp; Droid Sans</li><li>Corbin &amp; Nobile</li><li>Ubuntu &amp; Vollkorn</li><li>Montserrat and Oswald</li><li>Merriweather and Special Elite</li><li>Homemade Apple and Raleway</li><li>Permanent Marker and Open Sans</li><li>Sniglet and Cabin</li><li>Raleway and Open Sans</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;bad choice&#8221; of a typeface is often blamed when a landing page fails to obtain conversions. However, bad typography is not always to be blamed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A design that relegates typography to secondary place where it is impossible to stand out is very common. The font may be hidden by a photograph, a poorly chosen color, or a poorly selected font size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing everything in such a way that it is striking and all the elements stand out by themselves is what is important. It does not matter if a landing page has many elements or not, the important thing is that the purpose of the landing page itself and its elements stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#ecf8f4\"><strong>To save time and improve conversions various landing page builder tools can be used. Some of the popular ones are Unbounce, Landingi, Leadpages, Lander and Elementor.</strong></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What typeface to choose for your landing page?

engine result page), it is to <strong>offer unique content that meets the research intention of the internet user</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that keyword research and search volumes are not enough. <strong>To be visible, your content must meet search intent</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Search Intent For SEO?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"721\" height=\"350\"

is the reason why the Internet user searches for a keyword or a phrase (a group of keywords)</strong>. A person can thus carry out a search to obtain an answer to a question, to find the official site of a brand or to research a specific product before buying it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Coined for the first time in 2002 by Andrei Broder, an employee of AltaVista, search intent is crucial for a successful SEO campaign.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broder says that the search intent can be divided into three different types:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Informational Search</li><li>Transactional Search</li><li>Navigational Search</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Informational Search</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These are the so-called generic searches.</strong> They are made by people who want to explore a particular topic and therefore their behavior is not expected to end with a purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These questions can be examples of informational search:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How do you clean microwave ovens?</li><li>How do I clean my microwave oven naturally?</li><li>Differences between vacuum cleaner and electric broom</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With Google showing more and more <strong>&#8220;People Also Ask&#8221;</strong> in SERPs, it is easy to identify and &#8220;capitalize&#8221; on these keywords or phrases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Having this type of content on the website gives you the opportunity to put the brand or site in front of users right at the beginning of their journey and thus increase the chances of the final purchase of a product.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a website begins to rank consistently for these types of questions, it almost certainly starts to be in a position of advantage over its competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, <strong>by optimizing your content for Featured Snippets and People Also Ask, it is possible to increase organic traffic</strong> and at the same time satisfy the informational needs of potential customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Transactional Search</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transactional searches are those that occur when the user is ready to make a purchase</strong>. These will be related to the categories or products on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re an online store selling kitchen appliances, you can build content around the following keywords &amp; phrases:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Best hand blender&nbsp;</li><li>Best coffee machines</li><li>Popular pressure cooker brands</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transactional searches will be essential for the website in question</strong> and should take precedence over informative searches when you start optimizing the website for SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Navigational Search</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Navigation searches are the easiest to understand and require little effort in terms of optimization</strong>. They are carried out with the intent to go directly to a specific web page, which is known to exist, to perform an action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They coincide with branded searches even though Google seems to treat them differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, users may not know the exact URL and the search engines are used to support the browser navigation bar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of navigational searches could be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Facebook login page</li><li>Netflix subscription page</li><li>Spotify login page</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>This type of search usually leads to high conversion rates. On the other hand, these users already know your company, so they cannot become new customers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those brands that are not included in the search, it can be a way of intercepting competitors&#8217; traffic, albeit at a definitely reduced conversion rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Is Understanding The User&#8217;s Intention Important In SEO?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"526\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Is-Understanding-The-Users-Intention-Important-In-SEO.jpg\" alt=\"Why Is Understanding The User's Intention Important In SEO?\" class=\"wp-image-2830\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Is-Understanding-The-Users-Intention-Important-In-SEO.jpg 526w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Is-Understanding-The-Users-Intention-Important-In-SEO-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, the goal was to position oneself on target keywords without taking into account the quality of the content offered or whether it really corresponded to what the Internet user was looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google is now developing its data analysis capabilities and artificial intelligence algorithms to better understand what are the real intentions behind the search carried out</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can reformulate the keywords typed by Internet users to offer content that is much more relevant than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your content and landing pages should be tailored to your audience and their needs</strong>.

Create your lists of keywords and classify them by type of intention</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you start working on your SEO strategy, researching keywords to rank on is a starting point.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, search volume was the main selection factor. Now, the factors to consider when researching keywords have evolved, with user intent becoming a determining factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Optimizing the content for the user&#8217;s expectations is the priority, targeting a particular keyword is no longer the right strategy to adopt.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To identify a strategy, you can operate as follows:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do a keyword research by search volume.</li><li>Classify keywords by categories.</li><li>Assign an intention to each keyword.</li><li>Determine the usefulness of each keyword and its intent in your marketing strategy.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They are important to optimize content for local SEO and queries targeted to a geographic area in order to stand out from your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Segmenting targeted keywords based on intent will help you identify and fill in the gaps in your keyword targeting</strong>. By developing this thinking, the most profitable keywords and intentions for your business will be quickly identified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some keywords and irrelevant intentions for your business may be dismissed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Observe Google results</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google has gone from a search engine to a response engine</strong>. With the arrival of artificial intelligence at Google (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RankBrain\">Rankbrain</a>) and algorithms such as <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/\">BERT</a>, to better understand Internet users&#8217; requests, the search engine is refining its ability to better understand Internet users&#8217; intentions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>If you want to better understand the search intentions of Internet users, check the SERPs for the keywords you are targeting.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By observing the results, you will be able to get an idea of ​​the intent of the user that Google has identified for a particular query and what content it highlights to answer them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can analyze and understand why some pages rank higher than others and identify the topics covered and the angle used to cover it</strong>. If a specific type of content is highlighted, creating content in the same style will be more relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Observe the similarities of the best results:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Type of content (blog post, product page, video…).</li><li>Content format (guide, reviews, comparison, listing).</li><li>Angle of treatment of the subject.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Modify or create adapted content</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By observing which pages appear at the top of search results, you will be able to know the type of information and content that is highlighted for the keywords you are targeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help you <strong>focus on the type of information to include in your content and create content that has a chance to rank</strong>. Analyzing SERPs will help you better understand how to make your content relevant to the query and make it better than the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>If you&#8217;ve created content before, it&#8217;s time to pick it up and adapt it rather than starting from scratch with new posts. Take the time to analyze your content to see how well the information matches search intent and how it can be improved to meet them perfectly.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask yourself these questions and do this study before creating any content:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the purpose of this search for users?</li><li>What is the intention that Google identified in its results?</li><li>What type of content is most suited to the trend?</li><li>How can I stand out from my competitors?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Write clearly and precisely</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your content may contain the information the user needs, but, if your page is not easy and pleasant to read, its search intent will not be satisfied, and you will be penalized by the Google algorithm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep in mind these few simple rules in your SEO strategy:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Write short and simple sentences</li><li>Integrate the etymological field associated with your keywords</li><li>Limit your paragraphs to 4 lines maximum</li><li>Integrate question / answer formats in the form of bulleted or numbered lists</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having all of the building blocks for an effective user experience tells the Google algorithm that your content meets the user&#8217;s search intent for that keyword.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Add value to your content</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To satisfy both the Google algorithm and the search intent of your target, your page must be rich and offer real added value.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>If a user is looking for information, offer him quality content that will meet his expectations.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimize your content by including the following elements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original and thought-provoking reflection&nbsp;</li><li>Information-rich reports or research</li><li>Visual content to enrich your content: infographics, videos, tutorials, etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If, on the other hand, the search intent of your target is transactional, you should instead optimize your site for action and conversion.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, consider the following elements to integrate into your page:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Case studies or testimonials from former clients, in clear and pictorial form</li><li>Call to action button: “Book now”, “Contact us”, “Download here”, etc.</li><li>Subscribe to a newsletter</li><li>Presence of an FAQ concerning the conditions of sale</li><li>Livechat to help potential customers who need more information</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Attracting qualified traffic to your website is not easy. Indeed, before setting up your SEO battle plan, you will need to determine how your audience searches on the internet and what expressions they are likely to type in the Google search engine.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <strong>your subjectivity and analytical mind will play a major role in your selection of phrases</strong> since it will be up to you and only you to determine whether these search intentions will benefit your business.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SEO is not an exact science and Google proves it to us every day with each new update of its algorithm.

For example, sidewalk cafe and sidewalk café.</li><li>If a user query is longer than 16 words and your negative keyword follows that 16<sup>th</sup> word, your ad might still be shown, irrespective of the match type you choose.</li><li>Ensure that your negative keywords don&#8217;t intersect with your regular keywords for which you want your ad to display, because this will cause your ad not to show.</li><li>Don’t add too many negative keywords at once. It will do more harm than good because it will be difficult for you to pinpoint what’s working and what’s not.  </li><li>If you want to add negative keywords to multiple campaigns, use negative keywords lists instead of manually adding negative keywords to each campaign.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choosing the right keywords for your Google Ads campaigns is a prerequisite for your campaigns to be effective.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But completing this step without having selected the negative words reduces your chances of appearing in the right searches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Once you find your negative keywords and add them to an ad group or campaign, don&#8217;t forget to constantly refine your ad targeting through them. </strong></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard of negative keywords, you&#8217;re probably wasting a lot of money on Adwords.
