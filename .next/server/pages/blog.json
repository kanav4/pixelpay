What is the ideal typeface for landing pages?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing your landing page, you will have encountered one of the biggest doubts that usually exists: typography. Finding the perfect typeface for landing pages is tricky, as each typeface has an &#8220;ideal&#8221; use and its readability varies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#ecf8f4\"><strong>According to many studies, reading on the screen is 25% more difficult and slower than reading something that’s printed on paper.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the web, in fact, we read when we are really interested in it. We tend to look for highlighted words or more significant titles to understand if the page corresponds to what we are looking for. Everything that does not seem important to us and all those parts where the text is not easy to read is skipped by us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, without a doubt choosing the correct typeface is a factor to consider when designing a landing page. It is not a mere designer whim: finding the right typeface can affect the conversion rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shape of the words also has the power to communicate, beyond what the words say. Knowing that power and how to apply it is important to drive your marketing goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Typography?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Typography can be defined as typefaces that share common characteristics. Numbers and symbols are also included in that common type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All fonts vary from one another on issues such as thickness, spacing, serif, etc. All these elements make a typeface have its own, personal characteristics, necessary to differentiate itself from others.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Choose The Perfect Typeface For Your Landing Page?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of fonts can be very interesting and lead to results of all kinds. For this reason, it is not surprising that when designing a website, you end up making beginner mistakes, easy to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips you can follow to find an ideal landing page font:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Clarity Above All</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Users generally do not spend more than a few seconds viewing the content of a page. For this reason, the fonts you choose must be readable in a very short time, and must be displayed perfectly on mobile. Use a few different fonts, to achieve a clear hierarchy of information that helps users quickly understand the content of the landing page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Hind and Montserrat work very well for headlines. For smaller text sizes, like product descriptions, choose something serifed like Merriweather that works great for body text or Open Sans that adjusts to a wide variety of weights making it more versatile.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Combine Fonts With Each Other And With Other Visual Elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an art to compose with types that combine well. However, it is not convenient to choose more than two or three different types for the same landing page, so choose wisely how to combine. A good tactic is to choose a font family and use its variants (light, bold, condensed).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in turn, keep in mind how those fonts look with the visual environment of the landing page: the colors, the images, the layout. There are fonts that look great on a blank screen, but with some color combination they become illegible. Try different options to see which ones look perfect in your design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try the combination of headlines in Lato (Thin) with body text in Merriweather for something elegant. The titles in Roboto Slab and text in Open Sans are also very good for something more dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Convey The Essence Of The Product</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Typography has the power to evoke certain sensations that must be aligned with the product or service that you are promoting on your landing page. And that has a strong cultural support: in certain areas, we are used to seeing certain typefaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respecting those expectations helps to communicate the message more easily and connect better with the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your landing is for wedding cakes, an italic typeface for the headline and an elegant Serifa to detail the menu will work best. If instead you have a technology startup for students, you will opt for a modern and practical typeface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to thinking about the product, service or category of your landing, think about your audience. For younger generations, aim for more trendy fonts like Roboto or Lato. If your audience is more mature, choose fonts that convey confidence and seriousness, such as Times New Roman or Georgia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Take Care Of The Institutional Image</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work with a brand that has a well-defined aesthetic, with a typography already established for its graphic content, you must take care that the typefaces of your landing are aligned to them. And if there is no guideline regarding the fonts to be used, check that they match well with the logo. The design of your landing can not be a collage of aesthetic cutouts. It should give a unified and pleasant message.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Be Original Without Losing Simplicity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some designs deliberately seek to break some typographic rules to generate a new meaning. If you are going to design “out of the box” (for example, combining two typefaces in the same paragraph, or creating an entirely typographic composition, without images), you must do it intentionally and make sure that the artistic game does not go against your conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take advantage of the A / B Testing tool to find out which typefaces bring the best conversion results.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Where To Look For The Ideal Typography For Your Website?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By offering an intuitive and robust collection of open source designer web fonts, Google Fonts has established itself in the world of web design as the go to source for typefaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google font is:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A catalog of 915 font families</li><li>Fonts available in 135 languages</li><li>100% free and open source fonts</li><li>Fonts that are easy to install and the fastest to load</li><li>Fonts compatible with all browsers and devices</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The richness and diversity of the fonts offered is undoubtedly an element that explains the success of Google Fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#ecf8f4\"><strong>To integrate a Google Fonts font, simply copy and paste a line of HTML code into the &lt;head> of your website and fill in the @ font-face rule in your CSS. The integration is extremely simple, especially when compared with Flash or JavaScript integrations.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, Google Fonts allows you to easily mix several fonts, in order to create combinations. The number of possible combinations is enormous.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>On Which Criteria To Choose Your Google Fonts?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Faced with the quantity of fonts available on Google Fonts, a question immediately arises: how to choose a font? What criteria should be taken into account? Defined below are 4 criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Readability</strong>, which is the most important criterion. The font must be as readable as possible, whatever the type of screen used and the display resolution.</li><li><strong>Flexibility and diversity</strong>. The font must offer at least three styles (light, regular, bold…) in order to allow you to rank the pages of your website.</li><li><strong>Efficiency</strong>. You must choose a font with a full glyphset. In fact, many free fonts have a very small number of glyphs (= special characters).</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong>. The font must be compatible with any browser. You must also take into account the &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; compatibility. The quality of the font must not be impacted by the quality of screens or operating systems.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Effectively Combine Google Fonts?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips for finding good font combinations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Use Font Families:</strong> Font families are groups of fonts that go well together. Combining two fonts belonging to the same family allows you to vary your fonts without any risk of errors. Google Fonts are precisely grouped by families.</li><li><strong>Play with contrasts:</strong> The whole point of combining several fonts is to then be able to play with contrasts. It is interesting, for example, to combine a &#8220;fat&#8221; font with a &#8220;light&#8221; sans-serif font. Mixing two fonts that are very similar from an aesthetic point of view is of no real interest and affects readability.</li><li><strong>Limit yourself to a maximum of three fonts</strong>, both for readability and load time reasons. Adding web fonts tends to slow the loading time of your pages.</li><li><strong>Choose combinations depending on the type of content</strong> that is present on your site. If you go for a modern writing style and editorial line, choose a font that exemplifies this quality.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A few font associations that work quite well:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lobster &amp; Cabin</li><li>Raleway &amp; Goudy Bookletter 1911</li><li>Allerta &amp; Crimson Text</li><li>Arvo &amp; PT Without</li><li>Dancing Script &amp; Josefin Sans</li><li>Allan &amp; Cardo</li><li>Molengo &amp; Lekton</li><li>Droid Serif &amp; Droid Sans</li><li>Corbin &amp; Nobile</li><li>Ubuntu &amp; Vollkorn</li><li>Montserrat and Oswald</li><li>Merriweather and Special Elite</li><li>Homemade Apple and Raleway</li><li>Permanent Marker and Open Sans</li><li>Sniglet and Cabin</li><li>Raleway and Open Sans</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;bad choice&#8221; of a typeface is often blamed when a landing page fails to obtain conversions. However, bad typography is not always to be blamed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A design that relegates typography to secondary place where it is impossible to stand out is very common. The font may be hidden by a photograph, a poorly chosen color, or a poorly selected font size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing everything in such a way that it is striking and all the elements stand out by themselves is what is important. It does not matter if a landing page has many elements or not, the important thing is that the purpose of the landing page itself and its elements stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#ecf8f4\"><strong>To save time and improve conversions various landing page builder tools can be used. Some of the popular ones are Unbounce, Landingi, Leadpages, Lander and Elementor.</strong></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What typeface to choose for your landing page?

engine result page), it is to <strong>offer unique content that meets the research intention of the internet user</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that keyword research and search volumes are not enough. <strong>To be visible, your content must meet search intent</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Search Intent For SEO?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"721\" height=\"350\"

is the reason why the Internet user searches for a keyword or a phrase (a group of keywords)</strong>. A person can thus carry out a search to obtain an answer to a question, to find the official site of a brand or to research a specific product before buying it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Coined for the first time in 2002 by Andrei Broder, an employee of AltaVista, search intent is crucial for a successful SEO campaign.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broder says that the search intent can be divided into three different types:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Informational Search</li><li>Transactional Search</li><li>Navigational Search</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Informational Search</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These are the so-called generic searches.</strong> They are made by people who want to explore a particular topic and therefore their behavior is not expected to end with a purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These questions can be examples of informational search:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How do you clean microwave ovens?</li><li>How do I clean my microwave oven naturally?</li><li>Differences between vacuum cleaner and electric broom</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With Google showing more and more <strong>&#8220;People Also Ask&#8221;</strong> in SERPs, it is easy to identify and &#8220;capitalize&#8221; on these keywords or phrases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Having this type of content on the website gives you the opportunity to put the brand or site in front of users right at the beginning of their journey and thus increase the chances of the final purchase of a product.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a website begins to rank consistently for these types of questions, it almost certainly starts to be in a position of advantage over its competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, <strong>by optimizing your content for Featured Snippets and People Also Ask, it is possible to increase organic traffic</strong> and at the same time satisfy the informational needs of potential customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Transactional Search</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transactional searches are those that occur when the user is ready to make a purchase</strong>. These will be related to the categories or products on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re an online store selling kitchen appliances, you can build content around the following keywords &amp; phrases:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Best hand blender&nbsp;</li><li>Best coffee machines</li><li>Popular pressure cooker brands</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transactional searches will be essential for the website in question</strong> and should take precedence over informative searches when you start optimizing the website for SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Navigational Search</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Navigation searches are the easiest to understand and require little effort in terms of optimization</strong>. They are carried out with the intent to go directly to a specific web page, which is known to exist, to perform an action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They coincide with branded searches even though Google seems to treat them differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, users may not know the exact URL and the search engines are used to support the browser navigation bar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of navigational searches could be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Facebook login page</li><li>Netflix subscription page</li><li>Spotify login page</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>This type of search usually leads to high conversion rates. On the other hand, these users already know your company, so they cannot become new customers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those brands that are not included in the search, it can be a way of intercepting competitors&#8217; traffic, albeit at a definitely reduced conversion rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Is Understanding The User&#8217;s Intention Important In SEO?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"526\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Is-Understanding-The-Users-Intention-Important-In-SEO.jpg\" alt=\"Why Is Understanding The User's Intention Important In SEO?\" class=\"wp-image-2830\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Is-Understanding-The-Users-Intention-Important-In-SEO.jpg 526w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Is-Understanding-The-Users-Intention-Important-In-SEO-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, the goal was to position oneself on target keywords without taking into account the quality of the content offered or whether it really corresponded to what the Internet user was looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google is now developing its data analysis capabilities and artificial intelligence algorithms to better understand what are the real intentions behind the search carried out</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can reformulate the keywords typed by Internet users to offer content that is much more relevant than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your content and landing pages should be tailored to your audience and their needs</strong>.

Create your lists of keywords and classify them by type of intention</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you start working on your SEO strategy, researching keywords to rank on is a starting point.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, search volume was the main selection factor. Now, the factors to consider when researching keywords have evolved, with user intent becoming a determining factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Optimizing the content for the user&#8217;s expectations is the priority, targeting a particular keyword is no longer the right strategy to adopt.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To identify a strategy, you can operate as follows:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do a keyword research by search volume.</li><li>Classify keywords by categories.</li><li>Assign an intention to each keyword.</li><li>Determine the usefulness of each keyword and its intent in your marketing strategy.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They are important to optimize content for local SEO and queries targeted to a geographic area in order to stand out from your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Segmenting targeted keywords based on intent will help you identify and fill in the gaps in your keyword targeting</strong>. By developing this thinking, the most profitable keywords and intentions for your business will be quickly identified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some keywords and irrelevant intentions for your business may be dismissed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Observe Google results</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google has gone from a search engine to a response engine</strong>. With the arrival of artificial intelligence at Google (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RankBrain\">Rankbrain</a>) and algorithms such as <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/\">BERT</a>, to better understand Internet users&#8217; requests, the search engine is refining its ability to better understand Internet users&#8217; intentions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>If you want to better understand the search intentions of Internet users, check the SERPs for the keywords you are targeting.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By observing the results, you will be able to get an idea of ​​the intent of the user that Google has identified for a particular query and what content it highlights to answer them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can analyze and understand why some pages rank higher than others and identify the topics covered and the angle used to cover it</strong>. If a specific type of content is highlighted, creating content in the same style will be more relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Observe the similarities of the best results:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Type of content (blog post, product page, video…).</li><li>Content format (guide, reviews, comparison, listing).</li><li>Angle of treatment of the subject.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Modify or create adapted content</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By observing which pages appear at the top of search results, you will be able to know the type of information and content that is highlighted for the keywords you are targeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help you <strong>focus on the type of information to include in your content and create content that has a chance to rank</strong>. Analyzing SERPs will help you better understand how to make your content relevant to the query and make it better than the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>If you&#8217;ve created content before, it&#8217;s time to pick it up and adapt it rather than starting from scratch with new posts. Take the time to analyze your content to see how well the information matches search intent and how it can be improved to meet them perfectly.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask yourself these questions and do this study before creating any content:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the purpose of this search for users?</li><li>What is the intention that Google identified in its results?</li><li>What type of content is most suited to the trend?</li><li>How can I stand out from my competitors?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Write clearly and precisely</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your content may contain the information the user needs, but, if your page is not easy and pleasant to read, its search intent will not be satisfied, and you will be penalized by the Google algorithm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep in mind these few simple rules in your SEO strategy:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Write short and simple sentences</li><li>Integrate the etymological field associated with your keywords</li><li>Limit your paragraphs to 4 lines maximum</li><li>Integrate question / answer formats in the form of bulleted or numbered lists</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having all of the building blocks for an effective user experience tells the Google algorithm that your content meets the user&#8217;s search intent for that keyword.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Add value to your content</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To satisfy both the Google algorithm and the search intent of your target, your page must be rich and offer real added value.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>If a user is looking for information, offer him quality content that will meet his expectations.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimize your content by including the following elements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Original and thought-provoking reflection&nbsp;</li><li>Information-rich reports or research</li><li>Visual content to enrich your content: infographics, videos, tutorials, etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If, on the other hand, the search intent of your target is transactional, you should instead optimize your site for action and conversion.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, consider the following elements to integrate into your page:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Case studies or testimonials from former clients, in clear and pictorial form</li><li>Call to action button: “Book now”, “Contact us”, “Download here”, etc.</li><li>Subscribe to a newsletter</li><li>Presence of an FAQ concerning the conditions of sale</li><li>Livechat to help potential customers who need more information</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Attracting qualified traffic to your website is not easy. Indeed, before setting up your SEO battle plan, you will need to determine how your audience searches on the internet and what expressions they are likely to type in the Google search engine.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <strong>your subjectivity and analytical mind will play a major role in your selection of phrases</strong> since it will be up to you and only you to determine whether these search intentions will benefit your business.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SEO is not an exact science and Google proves it to us every day with each new update of its algorithm.

In addition, <strong>these titles are more conducive to sharing since they provoke strong emotions and reactions from readers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But while these titles often work well, sometimes they don&#8217;t get much popularity as they are sometimes manipulative and very sensational.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>NOTE: It is also important to note that if this kind of title is misused, the image of your brand can be seriously damaged.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>SEO Titles Vs Clickbait Titles</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As for the question of which of the two performs the most, the opinions of marketers are quite different.</strong> The good news is that a deep analysis reveals that you don&#8217;t have to make a choice between either of these titles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, <strong>it is possible to satisfy both search engine algorithms and Internet users.</strong> To do this, you just have to mix it up to have a good <strong><em>“SEO clickbait title”</em></strong> and here is the best way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Steps To Follow Before Creating Captivating Titles</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"525\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Steps-To-Follow-Before-Creating-Captivating-Titles.jpg\" alt=\"Steps To Follow Before Creating Captivating Titles\" class=\"wp-image-2812\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Steps-To-Follow-Before-Creating-Captivating-Titles.jpg 525w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Steps-To-Follow-Before-Creating-Captivating-Titles-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing great SEO clickbait titles isn&#8217;t as difficult as you might think, as long as you put yourself in the reader&#8217;s shoes. <strong>Once you know what your target audience is looking for, you&#8217;ll present your topic in a way that will capture their attention and interest them.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Know what you&#8217;re writing about and who you&#8217;re writing for</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The catchiest headline in the world won&#8217;t do you any good if you don&#8217;t understand your topic or know your target audience well. This first step is the basis for all the other steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Write on a topic relevant to your target audience;</strong></li><li><strong>Deliver what your target audience wants;</strong></li><li><strong>Use the right triggers to get them to act.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Determine Your Topic Keyword</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second step in writing a catchy title is to <strong>determine the main keyword for your topic.</strong> Once you master your audience, you know what kind of words or phrases are going to be particularly effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Determine the Benefits Your Content Offers</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you sit down to start creating headlines, think about the benefits your article or product offers to the readers. Ask yourself questions such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Will they learn something new?</strong></li><li><strong>Will they become more effective or efficient?</strong></li><li><strong>Will they be able to solve a problem?</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that whatever benefit you give to your readers, make sure your content actually delivers on that promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Choose an approach for the title</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every copywriter has their own approach, but <strong>here are some of the common approaches that can help you get more readers:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1. Sensationalism</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As in journalism, <strong>this type of headline aims to produce a strong impression of surprise, admiration or interest</strong>, which tends to quickly pique the curiosity of readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2. Controversy</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking a stand on an important issue or <strong>expressing your opinion can be very effective in attracting readers</strong> and increasing click-through rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the use of controversy bothers some people. <strong>Avoid subjects related to religion or politics.</strong> They are extremely sensitive topics and you don’t want to get a bad reputation and offend people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>3. Problem solving</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>People read your content and buy your products because they want to solve their problems</strong>, improve their performance, or take advantage of certain opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you state in your headline that you are offering a solution to their problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>4. Use of formulas</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Proven formulas make it easy to create titles. Instead of going all out on your own creating your headlines, you can <strong>use effective formulas to grab attention and encourage clicks</strong>. When you run out of inspiration, headline formulas are secret weapons you can use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Step 5: Write several titles</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t stop at just 1 or 2 titles for your content. Write as many as possible: Before, during and even after creating your content. <strong>Try different formulas, words and phrases.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing more titles takes time, but it also allows you to be more creative and choose the best title you can find.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Characteristics Of A Powerful And Eye-Catching Headline</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"542\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Characteristics-Of-A-Powerful-And-Eye-Catching-Headline.jpg\" alt=\"Characteristics Of A Powerful And Eye-Catching Headline\" class=\"wp-image-2813\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Characteristics-Of-A-Powerful-And-Eye-Catching-Headline.jpg 542w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Characteristics-Of-A-Powerful-And-Eye-Catching-Headline-300x194.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The main purpose of the title is to get the readers to click on your article to read the content</strong>. The goal is to offer catchy titles and sub-titles that arouse interest in reading and push them to read the rest of your content in more detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Make your titles unique</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Having unique titles simply means that they are different from others or one of a kind.</strong> The big question is how to stay different. The easiest way is to type your title on Google and surround the title with double quotes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Google search returns with &#8220;no matches found&#8221; it means that the phrase is unique and has not yet been used as a title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>The idea is to simply write a headline that no one else has written yet.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Write ultra-specific titles</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second rule for your headline to grab attention is to be ultra-specific. <strong>Headlines that are ultra-specific give the readers an idea of ​​what to expect when they click to read the content.</strong> So, be specific and get straight to the point to avoid confusing your readers with fuzzy headlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>The key to being ultra-specific is knowing your audience and writing headlines that will meet their needs.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your keyword is &#8220;chocolate&#8221;, you can have the following variants:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>5 simple steps to making chocolate: For beginners</li><li>Top 10 Recipes for Making White Chocolates</li><li>Learn how to make chocolate from scratch</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Convey a sense of urgency</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s about creating a fear of losing out on an incredible deal in the mind of the readers. <strong>Without this sense of urgency, readers may postpone reading your content for another time with the risk of never coming back to it again.</strong> The idea here is to get your audience to click on your title &#8220;now&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you use urgency, people aren&#8217;t going to ignore your headline</strong> because they&#8217;re not going to want to miss what&#8217;s on the other side of the headline. And the only way for them to find out is to click and read your article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you are a public speaker and want to help other people become better speakers, you can try the following variations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>6 tips I used to give my first speech (and how you can do the same with a simple tip)</li><li>I&#8217;ll tell you how I overcame my fear of public speaking</li><li>My well-kept secret to get my message across quickly</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Make your title useful</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To make your headline grab attention, you need to make it &#8220;useful&#8221; to readers. <strong>If the title seems irrelevant to the reader, no matter how unique, specific, or urgent it is, it will not be clicked on.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &#8220;useful&#8221; can mean several things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Convenient</li><li>Precious</li><li>Informative</li><li>Beneficial</li><li>Advantageous</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The main thing is to help readers solve their problems with your content.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Choose an ideal length</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Between a title consisting of sixty words and another of ten words, which one will you choose? The second title seems more concise and will have every chance of being more successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, <strong>a long headline can seem boring or give the impression that you don&#8217;t know what you’re writing about. Be concise and to the point.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Google tends to truncate titles when they are long. A title that is too short, on the other hand, may seem too generic and will not make readers want to click. So, what is the ideal length for a title?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>To answer this question, <a href=\"https://buzzsumo.com/blog/most-shared-headlines-study/\">Buzzsumo carried out a study</a> of 100 million article titles and noticed that titles with 15 words or between 80 to 90 characters generate much more engagement, especially on Facebook.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>6. Write headlines that are simple and easy to understand</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make sure that the reader does not have to re-read the meta description before they understand what you are talking about</strong> in your content.

These include, among others:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Tips</strong></li><li><strong>Lessons</strong></li><li><strong>Tricks</strong></li><li><strong>Ideas</strong></li><li><strong>Techniques</strong></li><li><strong>Principles</strong></li><li><strong>Facts and Figures</strong></li><li><strong>Secrets</strong></li><li><strong>Strategies</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>8 Lessons I learned the hard way when I started my business</li><li>5 Principles of efficient email marketing campaigns</li><li>11 Facts About Content Marketing You Didn&#8217;t Know</li><li>6 tips for writing blog titles like a pro</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tip 2: Ask a question</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Writing a title as a question has a psychological effect on the readers’ minds.</strong> The inherent lack of completeness of the questions arouses tension and interest among readers compelling them to click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>It can also improve SERP ranking because the natural language of a complete question helps Google understand the usefulness of the article.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What superhero are you? Take this short quiz and find out!</li><li>How does social media affect SEO?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tip 3: Include numbers in your title</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using specific numbers or data in your headline is a great way to make it catchier.</strong> In this regard, studies have been carried out and have revealed that headlines containing numbers generate 73% more shares and engagement on social networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Instead of: Seven methods to generate traffic fast</li><li>Use: 7 Ways to Generate Traffic Fast</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tip 4: Use parentheses or square brackets</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using parentheses in your headlines is a very interesting approach that has even been adopted by some very popular editors around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.outbrain.com/blog/hubspot-outbrain-ebook/\">Hubspot and Outbrain conducted a study</a> on more than 3 million links and the finding is that titles with parentheses are 38% more efficient than those without.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two symbols have a rather attractive visual variety and allow you to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Giving Readers Extra Bonuses:</strong> 8 Powerful Sales Techniques to Double Your Conversion (Free Model Support)</li><li><strong>Generate Curiosity:</strong> 8 Powerful Sales Techniques to Double Your Conversion (# 5 Will Triple Your Sales)</li><li><strong>Boost credibility:</strong> 8 powerful sales techniques to double your conversion (which allowed me to earn INR 50,000 in 1 week).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tip 5: Use colons or hyphens&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The same study from Hubspot and Outbrain indicates that <strong>using a colon or hyphen can increase your headline click-through rate by 9%.</strong> Like parentheses and square brackets, these two symbols also add a visual effect that makes your titles attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simplest structure for using colons, or hyphens, is to place your keyword at the start of your title and add a compelling phrase after the symbols.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Generate Traffic: The 8 Little Known Ways to Explode Your Sales</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tip 6: Test negative headlines</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Studies have found that negative superlatives like &#8220;never&#8221; or &#8220;worse&#8221; get 63% more clicks than positive superlatives like &#8220;always&#8221; or &#8220;better&#8221;.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason for this preference for negative words is because positive words have been overused and sometimes lead to broken promises. In addition, these <strong>superlatives easily arouse fear in readers who will tend to click for information.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can, therefore, consider writing negative versions of your titles to have their performance tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Instead of:</strong> 7 fascinating ways to pass your exam</li><li><strong>Use:</strong> 7 bad habits to give up to avoid failing exams</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tip 7: Take inspiration from the competition</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the top tips for finding great titles is researching your competition. To do this, <strong>check if they have written content on the same or a similar topic before.</strong> If they have already done so, then you can look at the headlines of the most successful articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, <strong>researching your competition will also give you an idea of ​​which titles are ranking highest on Google.</strong> Looking at these titles will give you a better idea of ​​how to create your own. After all, your goal should be to stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tip 8: Use catchy adjectives</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using adjectives in your titles is a very effective practice. <strong>These words allow you to add additional information to another term</strong> and when put in the right place they can have a very powerful effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goinswriter has counted a few adjectives which have the quality of playing on the emotions of readers. They are:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fun</li><li>Free</li><li>Strange</li><li>Unbelievable</li><li>Effortlessly</li><li>Absolute</li><li>Essential</li><li>Annoying</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>10 fun ways to spend your vacation</li><li>5 tips incredible to successfully pass</li><li>The top 9 free tools to boost your traffic</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tip 9: Use Power Words</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You already understood it, all words are not equal. <strong>While some words have the power to spur action or change, others only reaffirm the status quo.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As proof, certain words can easily annoy some people, but others can provoke laughter. These kinds of words are referred to as Power words and here are a few that will help encourage your readers to take action:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Guarantee</li><li>Find out</li><li>Love</li><li>To prove</li><li>Safety or security</li><li>Save</li><li>New</li><li>Better</li><li>Now</li><li>Free</li><li>Increase</li><li>Try</li><li>Opportunity to seize</li><li>The easiest</li><li>Compare</li><li>Unique</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Using powers words in your content can increase your conversion rate by 12.7%, which is definitely not to be overlooked.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>10 guaranteed ways to save money every time you shop online</li><li>5 proven exercises to increase your height</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, <strong>the amount of content published daily on the web is simply colossal.</strong> This amount is only increasing day by day and internet users are constantly inundated with a ton of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, <strong>you have no choice but to think of the best way to capture their attention</strong> and one of the main options you have is to create compelling headlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>To make things easier, you can also use online tools for creating and optimizing titles. The tools that have the reputation of being the best include – Hemingway, HubSpot Blog Topic Builder, CoSchedule&#8217;s Headline Analyzer, IsItWP Headline Analyzer, Sharethrough, Emotional Marketing Value Headline Analyzer, SEOPressor’s Blog Title Generator, Linkbait Title Generator and BuzzSumo.</strong></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you know that a title determines up to 80% of the visits that a website receives?

Scroll Maps</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These are maps that show how much and how people scroll through a web page.</strong> They are interesting precisely because they show how low a user can scroll with the mouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use these heatmaps for any type of page, but they are particularly <strong>useful when you design very long landing pages and want to understand if the user will read them until the end</strong> (or at least to the point where you have placed your call to action).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Scroll maps can also help you optimize your design. The “hotter” the section, the more users have visited it. This type of information can be very helpful in determining the most appropriate page position for your call to action or the most important information.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changing colors on your scroll map can also help you figure out which section is causing your visitors to lose attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Click Maps</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>These heatmaps show aggregate click data. Blue means fewer clicks, red means more and the white and yellow spots signify the sections that have a greater concentration of clicks.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These maps are very useful from a &#8220;communicative&#8221; point of view. They can tell us what to optimize and what works.</strong> For example: do you have a photo on the page that takes a lot of clicks, but is not linked to anything? Perhaps it would be appropriate to put a link to some useful resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Hover Maps</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hover maps show areas where users move the cursor when reading your page.</strong> The hotter the area, the longer the cursor stops over it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>This data can help you determine how visitors actually browse your site, so you can place the most important elements in the areas that get the most attention.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also allows you to check if non-essentials are distracting your users from the most important ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. <strong>Form tester</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Form Tester helps analyze the behavior and interaction of the user on a form.</strong> Your landing page might be the best, but if there are issues with your form, the user will never convert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>The Form Tester helps analyze whether the form is readable, know where exactly users are leaving the form, and whether your form contains too many unnecessary fields that are preventing a conversion.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Session replay</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Many services that generate heatmaps also allow users&#8217; browsing sessions on your site to be recorded on video.</strong> For example, you can see how they fill out the forms on your pages, how quickly they read, how they scroll the page, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>It is very important to watch these videos to understand what bottlenecks and what problems the readers encounter, where they get stuck, where they give up and leave the page.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that you are recording real user sessions, and therefore the information you collect is of enormous value.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Benefits Of Using Heatmaps On Your Website</strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"525\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Benefits-Of-Using-Heatmaps-On-Your-Website.jpg\" alt=\"The Benefits Of Using Heatmaps On Your Website\" class=\"wp-image-2808\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Benefits-Of-Using-Heatmaps-On-Your-Website.jpg 525w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Benefits-Of-Using-Heatmaps-On-Your-Website-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Heatmaps help you understand how people interact with the pages of your website</strong>, so you can find answers to critical business issues, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Why are my users not converting enough?</li><li>How to ensure that more visitors act on my website?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using heatmaps, you can determine whether people can:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Go to important content or not see it at all</li><li>Find and use the main links, buttons and CTAs on the page</li><li>Get distracted by things they can&#8217;t click</li><li>Have problems with a particular type of device.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a visual tool, <strong>heatmaps help you make informed, data-driven decisions for updating &amp; redesigning your website and conducting A/B testing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they are also useful on a larger scale: in fact, <strong>heatmaps allow you to show the stakeholders, employees and colleagues what is happening on your website</strong>.

In addition to writing great content, which should always be your starting point, <strong>you can clearly describe its content in detail with a specific type of markup called Schema Markup.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a first glance, it may seem complicated, but once you’re familiar with what it is and how you can use it to your advantage, <strong>you can get amazing results when it comes to ranking high on search engines.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Schema Markup?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"443\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Schema-Markup-search-result-example-in-Google-SERP.jpg\" alt=\"Schema Markup search result example in Google SERP\" class=\"wp-image-2777\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Schema-Markup-search-result-example-in-Google-SERP.jpg 443w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Schema-Markup-search-result-example-in-Google-SERP-300x237.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Before delving into the importance of schema markup (structured data) for SEO, <strong>you need to understand what schema markup actually is.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Schema Markup is a way to describe to search engines what the content is about in a way they can understand. It can give context to a web page that otherwise seems ambiguous to search engines.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It includes tags and microdata that Webmasters can add to the HTML of their page.</strong> This data is not on the web page, but it organizes the information in such a way that it is machine-readable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All schemas for structured data can be found on <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">Schema.org</a></strong>, a collaborative, community activity founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The website lists 836 types of schemas at the time this article is published, but the commonly used types are:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Articles</li><li>Local businesses</li><li>Restaurants</li><li>TV episodes and ratings</li><li>Book reviews</li><li>Movies</li><li>Software applications</li><li>Events</li><li>Products</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Is Structured Data Important?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"711\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Structured-Data-written-on-a-yellow-background-and-a-magnifying-glass.jpg\" alt=\"Structured Data written on a yellow background and a magnifying glass\" class=\"wp-image-2776\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Structured-Data-written-on-a-yellow-background-and-a-magnifying-glass.jpg 711w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Structured-Data-written-on-a-yellow-background-and-a-magnifying-glass-300x148.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There was a reason why Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex created Schema.org.</strong> They believe it will really help with the overall search experience when used properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Correctly implementing structured data on your web page offers numerous advantages.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Provide better understanding to search engines</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main advantages of using Schema Markup and structured data is that you are <strong>providing a better understanding of search engines about the content published on your website.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes a search term can have two different meanings and the <strong>search engine algorithms can misunderstand the meaning of the term which can lead to irrelevant results</strong> and bad user experience (UX).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <strong>by using schema markup, you can clearly tell the search engine bots what your web page is about.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re writing about Apple, the fruit, you can mention that in the schema markup so that the bot does not confuse it with Apple, the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Appear on Google as rich snippets</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rich snippets are enhanced search results displayed by search engines on their SERP.</strong> They have more visual appeal and can help you stand out among your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rich Snippets are a result of the structured data markup on your website and can help you in boosting the Click-through Rate (CTR)</strong> of your web page. Common types of rich snippets include reviews, recipes and events.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Appear in Google’s knowledge graph</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you search for something on Google, the results that come on the right side of the search engine in a box or above the organic results in a carousel or photo gallery is the knowledge graph. <strong>Knowledge graph answers are picked up from various sources.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Knowledge graph has a positive impact on both user experience (UX) as well as website traffic.</strong> Appearing on Google’s knowledge graph will also give more visibility, authority and credibility to your brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you search for the word &#8220;pasta&#8221; on Google, you will get a detailed knowledge graph. First, you will see a definition of what is pasta, then you will see its place of origin and popular pasta dishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also see the nutritional facts about pasta in detail. And, at the very end of the knowledge, you’ll also be able to see <strong>“People also search for&#8221;</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By marking these types of information as structured data on your website, you are making it easier for Google to recognize the information.</strong> It will also give you a chance to appear in Google’s knowledge graph.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Get more social media followers</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasing the number of followers can also be accomplished with schema markup. <strong>If you markup your social media accounts, internet users will be able to see the relevant icons on Google SERP when they search for your brand.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When clicked, these icons will take the users to your business&#8217; social media platforms</strong>. This can be a great way to increase your following organically without any paid push.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Appear in the People also ask section</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a web page that contains a list of frequently asked questions and answers on a particular topic, you can mark it up with the FAQ schema. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using the FAQ schema can make you eligible to appear in the People also ask section on Google SERP</strong>. Appearing on these questions can have a positive impact on the traffic and CTR of your webpage.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>General Structured Data Guidelines</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"526\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GUIDELINES-written-on-a-red-colored-wooden-block.jpg\" alt=\"GUIDELINES written on a red colored wooden block\" class=\"wp-image-2775\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GUIDELINES-written-on-a-red-colored-wooden-block.jpg 526w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GUIDELINES-written-on-a-red-colored-wooden-block-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google has formulated some general guidelines that are applicable to all structured data. </strong>Web pages must follow these guidelines to ensure that their structured data is eligible for inclusion on Google SERP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are two types of guidelines that need to be followed – technical &amp; quality.</strong> The compliance of technical guidelines can be easily tested using a URL inspection tool and rich results test on Google Search Console. Quality guidelines, however, cannot be tested using any automated tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Violating any of these guidelines can result in your web page receiving a less favorable ranking or being marked as ineligible for rich results. It can even be marked as spam.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Technical Guidelines</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Format</li><li>Access</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Format:</strong> To ensure that your page is eligible for rich results, it should be marked up using one of the three recommended formats &#8211; JSON-LD, Microdata and RDFa. Google advocates JSON-LD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> The Googlebot should have access to your structured data pages. It should not be blocked using robots.txt, no-index, or any other access control methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Quality Guidelines</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Content</li><li>Relevance</li><li>Completeness</li><li>Location</li><li>Specificity</li><li>Images</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content:</strong> All quality guidelines set by Google webmasters must be followed. The information provided should be up-to-date, original and relevant. The content that you markup should be visible to the readers. It should mislead or deceive them in any way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Your structured data should be a true representation of the content of the page. For example, if you’re making DIY videos, they should not be mislabeled as recipes. Live streaming broadcasts should not be labelled as local events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Completeness:</strong> For the different types of structured data you’re using on your web page, all required properties should be specified. Items that are missing required properties will be ineligible for rich results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> The structured data should be put on the page that it describes. If there are multiple pages for the same content, the structured data should be placed on all the pages and not just the canonical page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specificity:</strong> For each specific rich result type, use the specified structured data and properties only. The documentation for your specific rich result type will enumerate the guidelines to be followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Image:</strong> When you identify an image as a structured data property, ensure that the image actually belongs to the structured data of that type. All image URLs must be crawlable and indexable, else, the Googlebot will not be able to find and show them on SERP.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Add Structured Data To Your Site?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"811\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HOW-with-a-question-mark-with-the-blue-background.jpg\" alt=\"HOW with a question mark with the blue background\" class=\"wp-image-2774\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HOW-with-a-question-mark-with-the-blue-background.jpg 811w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HOW-with-a-question-mark-with-the-blue-background-300x129.jpg 300w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HOW-with-a-question-mark-with-the-blue-background-768x331.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s move on to the way to add a markup scheme to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all depends on how you want to go about it. Setting up structured data can even be quite a lengthy process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It basically depends on 3 factors:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The content management system you use to publish your site: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, etc.</li><li>The level of control you want to have,</li><li>And finally, the level of precision you want to achieve.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The following 3 options can be used to implement the markup scheme:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Manual addition,</li><li>The markup help tool provided by Google,</li><li>A WordPress plugin that does it seamlessly.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Option 1: Manually add your markup scheme</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This option is to <strong>manually add the structured data in the source code of your website.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not recommended to use this option unless you are fluent in PHP language. In short, you should be proficient in web development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Warning: you can do quite a bit of damage if you don&#8217;t do it right.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But manually entering your structured data has its advantages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You can tag as many blocks/structured data boxes as you want,</li><li>You can make sure that everything is done exactly the way you want it to be.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is an option to consider if and only if getting your hands on the code doesn&#8217;t scare you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Option 2: Use Google&#8217;s Markup Help Tool</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google provides a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/webmasters/markup-helper/\">structured data markup helper tool</a> to help webmasters add schema tags to their sites without much hassle.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google&#8217;s markup helper works for any site, no matter:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your host,</li><li>Your CMS system,</li><li>Or the range of products and services presented on your company&#8217;s website.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is quite simple to use and it is done in 3 steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Indicate the page</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>First, <strong>go to Google&#8217;s Structured Data Markup Helper</strong>. Make sure you are on the Site tab.</li><li>Then, <strong>choose the type of content from among the 12 categories offered by Google on which you want to add structured data</strong>. Without knowing it, you are choosing the “itemtype”.</li><li>Finally, <strong>copy and paste the URL of the page you want to mark with structured data.</strong> Paste it in the URL box at the bottom of the page.</li><li>If you want to mark up a piece of HTML code, choose the HTML tab and paste your code in the box provided for this purpose.</li><li>Once these fields have been filled in, <strong>click on the blue “Start tagging” button.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, it is also possible to add structured data to your emails. This is how Google recognizes that an email concerns a plane ticket, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Tag the data</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The “Tagging data” page is divided into 2 parts:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On the left is your content page the link of which you shared in the previous step.</li><li>On the right are “My data items”. In short, all the “itemprop” relating to the type of content you have chosen; article in this case.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To tag something:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select it directly in your content on the left using your mouse, which will highlight it in yellow.</li><li>When you release the mouse, a small popup window appears with all the different possible structured data.</li><li>Once selected, the area to the right “My Data Items” updates.</li><li>To tag an image, click on the image and choose &#8220;Image&#8221; from the box that appears.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the basic functions of the markup helper. <strong>The process is the same regardless of the type of content to be tagged.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you make a mistake, click on the highlighted area you want to correct, the popup window will appear. At the very top, you will see “Clear tag”. It is as simple as that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you go, the “My Data Items” window fills up with all the items you have marked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is not mandatory to mark all the elements in the area on the right</strong>, but I recommend that you do so comprehensively. This way your markup is as complete as possible. And that gives more weight to the SEO of the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are done tagging your page, <strong>click on the red &#8220;Create HTML&#8221; button on the top right corner.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Copy &amp; paste the HTML code</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the last step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Warning: By default, the proposed format is JSON-LD, which is the preferred format by Google. If you want the Microdata format, choose the Microdata option.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was quite easy so far. Now it will get a bit more complicated because you need to add this markup on your web page. This is the hardest part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For static pages, it&#8217;s pretty easy to markup your site.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Click on the &#8220;Download&#8221; button in the upper right corner.</li><li>Then go to the source code of this page.</li><li>Delete the existing code and paste this new code in its place.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand,<strong> if your business website has non-static pages, it is more difficult. And unfortunately, this is the case with most content management systems (CMS).</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worse yet, <strong>WordPress adds an additional difficulty because WordPress cuts out your content.</strong> You get the body of the text in your content editor, but the header is in another file.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Whats the problem in this?</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the markup needs to be placed in the header. This means that you will have to <strong>manually insert the code into your theme file</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;d rather warn you, <strong>you can easily break your website if you don&#8217;t do it right.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have backups of your site, if your site is broken, you are going to suffer to get it back on track. <strong>For this reason, I recommend that you hire a developer if you take this option.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second problem with Google&#8217;s markup helper is that <strong>you have to do the process described above for all of your pages one by one.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, with WordPress, as soon as things get complicated, there is always a developer who jumps at the chance to offer an extension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Option 3: Use a WordPress plugin</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If, like me, you&#8217;re one of the millions of people who use WordPress for their website, <strong>using a plugin to set up a markup scheme for your website is going to make everything easier.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are several dedicated plugins that you can use. The most popular ones are:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Schema Pro</li><li>All in One Schema Rich Snippets</li><li>Schema and Structured Data for WP &amp; AMP</li><li>WP SEO Structured Data Schema</li><li>Ultimate Blocks</li><li>StarCat Reviews</li><li>WP Review Pro</li><li>SNIP: Rich Snippets by WPBuddy</li><li>WPSSO Core</li><li>Schema APP Structured Data</li><li>Rankmath</li><li>Yoast</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize, <strong>Schema Markup can be a great way of boosting the SEO of your page and improve its visibility on SERP.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>The richer your link appears; the more likely Internet users will click on it and therefore visit your site.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your site lives up to their expectations, the bounce rate will decrease and you will improve your SEO. <strong>A lower bounce rate tells Google that your site is delivering what it promises.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, as structured data continues to gain in importance, there&#8217;s a good chance you can stay ahead of your competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it, if you have a hair salon for example and your 300 five-star reviews are visible on SERP, you are one step ahead of your competitor who has not posted their reviews.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever wondered how to make Rich Snippets (structured data), such as ratings, product information and contact details, appear in the search results for your website?

that voice search has to which it is essential to respond appropriately? <strong>There are a few key aspects to consider before you start optimizing a website for voice searches:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The main thing is that <strong>voice searches are used in a geo context.</strong> They are hyperlocal searches. It depends on where you are. The results will be different for each location. As you can see, the positioning and optimization of a website for voice searches raise questions that have not been considered so far.</li><li>Another aspect to consider is that <strong>it is a type of contextual search</strong>. Therefore, not only the searches of the previous users are taken into account to provide appropriate results, but the activity carried out at the specific time of the search is also taken into account.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When optimizing a site for voice search, you need to think about SEO differently.</strong> For example, voice search queries are longer than text ones. They tend to contain between three and five (or more) keywords.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that SEO consultants must detach themselves from the search for traditional keywords and approach this task differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Search queries tend to ask a specific question and typically use keywords like: who, how, what, where, the best, why and when.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Voice Search Ranking Factors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"526\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Five-stars-on-the-ladder-upgrade-rating.jpg\" alt=\"Five stars on the ladder upgrade rating\" class=\"wp-image-2768\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Five-stars-on-the-ladder-upgrade-rating.jpg 526w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Five-stars-on-the-ladder-upgrade-rating-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>In February 2018, <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/voice-search-seo-study\">Backlinko published research</a> that analyzed 10,000 results from Google Home. The purpose of this study was to better understand how Google Voice classification works and, above all, how to optimize a site for voice search.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research focused on 11 specific positioning factors, and here is a summary of the results.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>PageSpeed:</strong> The voice search results page loads on average in 4.6 seconds.</li><li><strong>HTTPS:</strong> 70.4% of voice search results are protected by the HTTPS protocol.</li><li><strong>Short, concise answers:</strong> The average result of a voice search is just 29 words.</li><li><strong>The role of Schema markup:</strong> 36.4% of the results of voice searches come from pages that use schema.</li><li><strong>Authoritative domains: </strong>The average Ahrefs domain rating for a voice search result is 76.8.</li><li><strong>Social media:</strong> The average voice search result has about 44 Tweets and 1,199 shares on Facebook.</li><li><strong>Simple, easy-to-read content:</strong> The average result of a voice search on Google is written to be understandable by high school students.</li><li><strong>Title:</strong> Very few voice search results were found to have the exact query in their title tag.</li><li><strong>Word Count:</strong> On average, the search results page of the voice search has approximately 2,312 words.</li><li><strong>Desktop searches:</strong> 75% of voice search results rank in the top 3 for that query.</li><li><strong>Featured Snippet:</strong> 40.7% of all voice searches come from a featured snippet.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Can I Optimize A Website For Voice Search?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"664\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UPDATE-Button-on-Computer-Keyboard.jpg\" alt=\"UPDATE Button on Computer Keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-2767\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UPDATE-Button-on-Computer-Keyboard.jpg 664w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UPDATE-Button-on-Computer-Keyboard-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what aspects of your website should you properly optimize for voice searches? <strong>Let’s take a look at the factors you should consider for voice search optimization (VEO):</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Include Conversational Keywords</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your keyword strategy for voice search must be more conversational in nature and imitate the way people speak and ask questions verbally.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to <strong>start thinking about the types of questions users tend to ask about your business</strong> and start documenting and recording the exact words they use when talking to customer service representatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, it is better to title your article &#8220;How to optimize your site for voice search&#8221; than &#8220;10 things to do to optimize your site for voice search&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have a list of questions and statements that customers provide over the phone, you can <strong>start creating content pages that focus on longer, more conversational search queries.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Use Structured Data Markup</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use structured data, through the markup provided by <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">schema.org</a></strong>, to give virtual assistants even more information about your website and its contents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Structured schema.org markup is essential for your website, as <strong>it helps you define more specific information and helps search engines to accurately analyze the content of your website and understand its context.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Rich Snippets: Capitalize on Position 0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, position 0 appears when a question is asked by the Internet user. But it can also pop up when the user searches for a definition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Featured snippet takes a very important place in voice search also because it gives a brief, clear and precise response to the request</strong>. Your SEO strategy for voice search should, therefore, focus on optimizing your content for the featured snippets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Keep in mind that appearing regularly in position 0 in SERP can boost the reputation of a website.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Adopt the FAQ Format</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The best way to appear in voice searches is to create pages in the form of FAQs (Questions and Answers).</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specific searches are more and more present in search results, unlike general searches.</strong> For example, instead of looking for “best smartphone “, we see searches such as &#8220;Which is the best smartphone for photos?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To have a chance of being quoted by a voice assistant, you must do research to anticipate questions from Internet users. <strong>Tools like <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a> and <a href=\"https://answerthepublic.com/\">Answer the public</a> are useful.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to write quick and relevant responses to give the information as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may sound difficult, but <strong>creating FAQ pages can not only help your site appear in voice searches but also improve your chances of being in rich snippets.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Write Clear And Relevant Answers</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any SEO expert knows how important content is to improve their positioning. The same goes for optimizing voice search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the common technique of selecting the right keywords and using them in your content will not give the best results. <strong>You must first study the search intent of your target audience and understand their question to answer it better.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>Try to give the best possible answer. If you think your answer is more relevant than that of others, then you are on the right track. The short answers have more chance of being in voice search results.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>6. Have A Mobile Friendly Site</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that more than <strong>50% of searches come from our mobile devices. </strong>In addition, Google has announced that 20% of these searches are carried out by voice command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These statistics are constantly increasing, hence the importance of optimizing your website to be mobile-friendly. This includes optimizing the design of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading habits on phones are different from those on computers. <strong>Smartphone users prefer simple and clear content.</strong> Sometimes they even browse the article, looking only at the titles and sub-titles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To improve readability, <strong>your mobile pages should, therefore, contain many spaces, shorter sentences, simple words to understand and even more catchy titles.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can use the <a href=\"https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly\">Google Mobile-Friendly Test</a> tool to assess whether your site is up to standard.</strong> The tool generates a detailed report describing the specific elements to be improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>7. Improve the Loading Speed of the Mobile Version of Your Website</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One of the essential aspects of optimizing a website for voice searches is very fast loading.</strong> Otherwise, the answer will not be provided in a timely manner and the search engine will not show it to the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the importance of creating optimized mobile pages comes in. Accelerated mobile pages or AMP are one of the key points to optimize a website for voice searches. <strong>By implementing AMP, the loading time of the different pages will be better.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The voice search results page loads on average in 6 seconds (which is 52% faster than the average)</strong>. Therefore, if you want to rank in voice search, make sure your site loads as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>8. Use Google My business</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a local business, you must have a clearly defined strategy to appear in local and voice searches. The first step is to <strong>complete your Google My Business listing and improve your local SEO</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google will determine your location and give you relevant suggestions. <strong>Keywords like &#8220;near me&#8221; or “near&#8221; are important keywords that you should keep in mind for your local SEO.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever the two keywords are searched, Google&#8217;s algorithm retrieves information from Google My Business listings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make sure to fill in your card with your name, address, hours and telephone number so that the assistant can easily access your information. </strong>By making this information available, you are helping Google in identifying and broadcasting your business on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>9. Switch to HTTPS</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>In 2014, <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\">Google announced</a> that it would favor secure sites, whether you are an e-commerce site or a blog.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the HTTPS, you can <strong>buy or obtain a free SSL certificate from your host.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The HTTPS protocol gives an additional signal to Google that your site is secure for your visitors (UX)</strong>. Therefore, it promotes your SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your competitors are not yet in HTTPS, you have a considerable advantage in search engines and especially in terms of voice searches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong><a href=\"https://backlinko.com/voice-search-seo-study\">According to Brian Dean</a>, 70% of voice search results come from pages in HTTPS. So, if you are not yet on HTTPS, what are you waiting for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>10. Improve Your Domain Authority</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Websites with strong authority tend to rank higher in voice search results. According to a study, <strong>the average domain authority of a voice search result is 76.8. This indicates that Google’s voice search algorithm focuses on authoritative trusted domains.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to improve domain authority is to <strong>get backlinks from high authority websites</strong>. Other factors like <strong>content quality, social signals, website structure and user-friendliness</strong> of your website are also considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>11. Implement a Solid Website Structure</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The structure and architecture of your site is an essential element of your voice search strategy. By establishing a well thought out structure, you are establishing a good foundation for your SEO strategy. <strong>A well-organized site structure should look like a pyramid.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>You can make the structure of your website clear by adding breadcrumbs, taxonomies like categories &amp; tags and contextual internal linking.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>If you want to market for voice search, you need to rethink your content in a more conversational way, trying to anticipate what the user could ask of a search engine or digital assistant.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing for voice is a big challenge, but with the right keyword and the right strategies, you can master it.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Voice search is a new type of human-machine interaction that allows virtual assistants to answer questions posed by people via voice.

Internet users hate slow websites</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the fact that information is accessible with a snap of the finger on the internet, visitors are inclined to leave/exit a website if it’s too slow to load. They’ll go to your competitor’s website where they can a quicker response. If you’re facing this situation, then, without a shadow of doubt, it’s your slow loading website that’s causing you to lose potential customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Optimization of the website’s SEO</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Google bots, that crawl and index websites, deem that an online page that takes too long to load (more than 8 seconds) is not good enough to be shown to Internet users. Therefore, optimizing your website’s speed guarantees the crawling &amp; indexing of your pages which has a positive impact on your traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Increased search relevancy of the web page</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The behaviour of the users in taken into account by Google to understand the relevancy of a page. If a website has a slow loading speed, behavioral indicators like average time spent on the website, bounce rate and the number of pages visited will be adversely affected. This will send a signal to the search engines that your website is not is not appropriate for the search queries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Enhanced performance of the website on mobile</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasingly, internet users are using their smartphones to surf the net. With an often-reduced internet speed on mobile, designing light website pages has become crucial so as to not see your mobile traffic reduced to zilch.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Correctly Perform A Speed Test Of A Website?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"525\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-businessman-holding-a-white-card-with-a-message-SPEED-TEST-written-on-it.jpg\" alt=\"A businessman holding a white card with a message SPEED TEST written on it\" class=\"wp-image-2761\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-businessman-holding-a-white-card-with-a-message-SPEED-TEST-written-on-it.jpg 525w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-businessman-holding-a-white-card-with-a-message-SPEED-TEST-written-on-it-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The main question is what needs to be measured? There are many measures of site speed, but only a few are essential. These basic metrics can be measured in seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The loading time of the first byte of the site i.e. time to first byte (TTFB) &#8211;</strong> This is the time from the start of loading until the reception of the first data from the server. This is the essential measure for server optimization.</li><li><strong>The beginning of the page display (start of the display, first image) &#8211; </strong>This measurement shows the first painting time i.e. the moment when the browser starts to display the page. This is important because, until this moment, the browser will only display a blank page to the user.</li><li><strong>Loading of the main elements of the page (loading time) &#8211; </strong>This includes loading and interpreting all the resources on the page. After obtaining these characteristics, the page loading indicator finishes its work.</li><li><strong>The complete loading of the page – </strong>This metric measures how long it takes for a page to load completely i.e. when all the main and secondary resources are loaded.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>The focus should be on improving the TTFB and then the complete page load time.

To help you see more clearly, here are several types of solutions to implement:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Use a CDN</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best techniques to improve the loading speed of a website is hosting your media files on a CDN (Content Delivery Network). <strong>This way you can free up to 60% of your website bandwidth.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A CDN locally redistributes the content of your site, saved on several servers spread around the world.</strong> This means that rather than loading in the “traditional” way, pages are saved and then redistributed faster than with conventional loading. Also, all CDNs activate page compressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Cache your site to speed up page display</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Website caching temporarily stores data on a web page to avoid systematically reloading content on each visit, thereby reducing the demand on the server. Most web hosts have quality caching solutions. <strong>If you&#8217;re using WordPress, one of the quickest and easiest ways to reduce the loading speed of your page is to install a caching plugin.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Compress your images</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Images are heavy files and they can use up a lot of server space. That’s why <strong>It is important to make sure website images are not larger than necessary, have the correct file format, and are compressed for the web.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select the right type of image file (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.)</li><li>Resize images correctly to ensure that their dimensions do not exceed the breadth of your web page template.</li><li>Use online tools to compress enormous images and accelerate image loading.</li><li>Contemplate distributing your images in webp format. This format offers superior compression but is not compatible with all browsers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Clean up the database of your website</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A website’s database can quickly become clogged with old post data, unused plugins, unapproved comments, article drafts, revisions of saved pages, unused tags and shortcodes. That’s why <strong>its important to cleanup your database to not only improve site speed, but also to improve the efficiency of the database itself.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Compress your website with Gzip</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider using gzip compression, which is responsible for compressing your content in order to reduce the data flow and therefore, gain loading speed. <strong>Gzip compresses all your files into a zip file. Then, when a user visits one of your pages, the files are unzipped by their web browser.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>6. Compress your CSS and JS files</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By optimizing your code (especially by removing spaces, commas and other unnecessary characters), you can significantly increase the loading speed of your page. <strong>The more code and files you have on a page, the longer it will take to load. Reducing the amount of HTML, CSS and JavaScript can speed up site loading speeds.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>7. Minimize your HTTP requests</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A website is made up of many elements, not always visible to the user. However, each of them requires an HTTP request, and therefore a reading, which increases the loading time of said page.</strong> Some of these elements are invisible and useless from the point of view of the user experience. So, they can be eliminated in order to reduce the number of requests as well as the loading time. To do this, inspect your web page, and carefully check each file to see if you need it or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>8. Prioritize the content to load</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using a condition in your code, you can prioritize to only load items that have been requested by the user.</strong> For example, it is not useful to load the content of a drop-down menu on which he does not click or to load the images at the bottom of the page if he does not scroll. This is called lazy loading. To use lazy loading, simply find the plugin compatible with the interface you’re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>9. Remove blocking resources</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some resources from a CSS library, or even data coming from Javascript, can be blocking. They must be downloaded during loading, before the display of the page, so that the latter is displayed entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some resources can be heavy. Consequently, the resource increases the loading time of the page. If this is your case, then you will need to eliminate these resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Delete the resources that the page does not need for the correct display. Place the others above the fold, so as to load only those that are necessary for relation to the user experience.</strong> Resources that should only be loaded when interacting can be placed below the waterline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>10. Disable unused plugins</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On content management systems like WordPress, plugins are mostly responsible for the slowdown of the site. <strong>If there are plugins that you no longer use or that are no longer essential, disable them to avoid unnecessary slowing down of the site.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Users demand websites that are fast loading. They expect a page to load fast, otherwise many will leave it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>According to <a href=\"https://blogs.akamai.com/2017/04/new-findings-the-state-of-online-retail-performance-spring-2017.html\">SOASTA Google study report 2017</a>, the likelihood that a user leaves a website is:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>32% if the loading time is 1 to 3 seconds</li><li>90% if the loading time of the site is 3-5 seconds</li><li>106% if the loading time of the site is 5-6 seconds</li><li>123% if the loading time of the site is between 6 and 10 seconds.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\"><strong>It is clear that the faster the loading, the better your site and user experience will be.

traffic.</strong> Depending on the niche, the competition can be tough and the CPCs (cost per click) very high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\" class=\"has-background\"><strong>The more you compete with many companies, on many keywords, the more likely you are to experience click fraud.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click fraud can have <strong>many harmful repercussions</strong> including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Poor quality traffic</li><li>Diminishing of the optimization work</li><li>Decline in profitability and return on investment (ROI)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Click Bombing?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Click Bombing is a process that consists of clicking a large number of times on a competitor&#8217;s ads or Google Ads ad extensions</strong> in order to generate unnecessary clicks which will still be billed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter

operation can have <strong>many advantages for unscrupulous competitors</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It <strong>makes you spend your Google Ads campaign budget unnecessarily</strong> and distort your statistics and acquisition costs.</li><li><strong>Your statistics are distorted</strong>, you can no longer trust the results obtained and will give up more easily or continue spending without noticing if the campaign remains profitable anyway. The conversion rate is distorted.</li><li><strong>Your ads are deactivated faster</strong> if your daily budget is reached, depriving you of potential customers.</li><li>Your <strong>competitors have more visibility</strong> in the results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Click Fraud Techniques</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"546\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Click-Fraud-Techniques.jpg\" alt=\"Click Fraud Techniques\" class=\"wp-image-2737\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Click-Fraud-Techniques.jpg 546w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Click-Fraud-Techniques-300x192.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Click fraud is done manually or automatically (by software).</strong> Here are some common methods:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Manual clicks:</strong> This method is not the most effective. It involves generating clicks manually. Either the fraudster clicks on the ads himself, or he solicits help from friends, relatives or colleagues.</li><li><strong>Click farms:</strong> These are mass clicks on banner ads, ads, videos or social media posts by employees who are often poorly paid and relocated. The consequences of these abusive clicks can be significant.</li><li><strong>Robots:</strong> Software is programmed to generate automatic clicks, making manual clicks by real people unnecessary.</li><li><strong>Botnet:</strong> In this, clicks are generated from several robots hosted on pirated servers. This method generates a large number of clicks under different IP addresses.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\" class=\"has-background\"><strong>In addition, certain campaigns on social networks or forums encourage people to click on advertisements or posts. Internet users thus themselves contribute to fraud by generating unnecessary costs for advertisers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Does Google Detect False Clicks?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google’s anti-fraud system works at three levels:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"525\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Does-Google-Detect-False-Clicks.jpg\" alt=\"How Does Google Detect False Clicks\" class=\"wp-image-2736\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Does-Google-Detect-False-Clicks.jpg 525w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Does-Google-Detect-False-Clicks-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The first level is <strong>automatic detection through filters</strong> that detect fraudulent clicks in real-time. They do not appear on the account and are not billed to the advertiser.</li><li>The second level corresponds to the <strong>analysis carried out offline by the Google Ads quality team</strong>. Its members act manually before advertisers are billed. <strong>They can &#8220;flag&#8221; an IP as fraudulent</strong>. All clicks from this IP are then deducted from the accounts before billing. If you have already noticed a sudden drop in the number of clicks during the day, it is probably linked to this intervention.</li><li>The last filter concerns <strong>advertisers&#8217; requests for invalid click surveys</strong>. The Google Ads quality team then investigates on a case-by-case basis. If your suspicions are confirmed, incorrect clicks will be re-credited to you.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Identify False Clicks Yourself?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To effectively protect yourself from fraudulent clicks on Google Ads, <strong>you will need several pieces of information</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The <strong>IP addresses of your visitors</strong> (via the extraction of your server logs).</li><li>The <strong>click timestamp</strong> (the time when someone clicks on your ad and reaches your website)</li><li>The <strong>action timestamp</strong> (the time when the person who reaches your website performs an action)</li><li>The <strong>User Agent</strong> (it determines if two users coming from the same IP are the same person thanks to different parameters such as the browser used, the operating system, etc.).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you come across an <strong>IP address with several click timestamps but no action timestamps</strong>, it’s most probably fraudulent.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"525\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-To-Identify-False-Clicks-Yourself.jpg\" alt=\"How To Identify False Clicks Yourself\" class=\"wp-image-2735\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-To-Identify-False-Clicks-Yourself.jpg 525w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-To-Identify-False-Clicks-Yourself-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find a potentially fraudulent IP, check who it belongs to and where it comes from. <strong>This site <a href=\"https://www.whatismyip.com/\">whatismyip.com</a> will be a good start to start your research.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Always keep an eye out for proxy servers</strong>. Do some research on the IP in question and check whether it belongs to a proxy server located in a public place like airport, mall, railway station, public institution, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also <strong>analyze the searches triggered by the IP in question.</strong> If they are varied, it&#8217;s most probably a proxy server. However, if the searches happen over a very short period of time and are similar, the clicks coming to you are most probably fraudulent.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Protect Yourself Against Fraudulent Clicks?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"526\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://ideadecoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-To-Protect-Yourself-Against-Fraudulent-Clicks.jpg\" alt=\"How To Protect Yourself Against Fraudulent Clicks\" class=\"wp-image-2734\" srcset=\"https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-To-Protect-Yourself-Against-Fraudulent-Clicks.jpg 526w, https://blog.pixelpaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-To-Protect-Yourself-Against-Fraudulent-Clicks-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think you are still being billed for clicks from competitors or potential robots despite Google&#8217;s controls?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can act in several ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Exclude Fraudulent IP In Your Adwords Interface</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusions are made at the level of each campaign. Go to Settings > All settings. In Advanced settings at the bottom of the page, select Excluding IP addresses and then add your address list. Please note, <strong>Google only allows adding 500 addresses per campaign</strong>, a limit that can quickly be reached on large accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Use Third-Party Services</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-party click fraud detection platforms are specialized in detecting fraudulent clicks. <strong>As soon as a fraudulent IP address is detected, it is automatically blocked.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These services use two detection methods &#8211; <strong>a tracking template to implement in your account and a code to install on your landing pages</strong>. Prices depend on the number of clicks you receive each month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Use Remarketing Lists</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The search network and display are compatible with remarketing lists. <strong>Remarketing will allow you to hide your ads from users who have behaved on your site.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can exclude people who spent less than 2 seconds on your site or those who did not scroll (the easiest method is to use a timer via Google Tag Manager). <strong>The downside of this method is that it is easily bypassed because it uses cookies.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Use Geographic Targeting</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find that most of the fraudulent IP addresses come from the same region/city, <strong>you can exclude it from your account interface</strong> (Settings > All settings > Zones).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method should be used with caution because <strong>if you exclude an area that is too large, you will also be deprived of qualified traffic.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>False clicks on AdWords are not inevitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"background-color:#c8e6db\" class=\"has-background\"><strong>By targeting your campaigns correctly and using remarketing wisely (not to exclude but to communicate differently with your prospects), you will limit the impact of fraud.</strong></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pay per click (PPC) campaigns can be a great opportunity for your business to get quality and targeted traffic.
